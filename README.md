## Drugs
### Marijuana
Marijuana plants can occasionally be found in jungle biomes, and marijuana seeds can be found in jungle temples. 
Harvesting weed drops marijuana trim, marijuana, marijuana seeds. Marijuana can be pressed into hash using a hash press.
Hash can be used to rip dabs with a dab rig filled with water (fill by right-clicking water) and hash in the player's offhand.

#### Future Plans:
- Bongs
- Joints
- Rosin & Resin dabs

### Alcohol
Not yet implemented, but will be crafted in the fermentation tank. Corn and yeast is used to make ethanol. 
Ergot and yeast are bacteria found rarely when harvesting wheat, carrot, potatoes, or beetroot.

#### Future Plans:
- Beer
- Wine & Grapes
- Vodka

### 2CB
Does not give effects at the moment

### 2CH
Used as a precursor for 2CB, does not have effects.

### Amphetamine
Synthesised from P2P, gives ten minutes of speed.

### Ketamine
Not fully implemented, created in refinery with oil. Gives 60 seconds of invisibility

### Diphenhydramine
Not fully implemented, created in refinery with oil. Gives several negative effects, consumption is discouraged

## Advancements
This mod features two advancement tabs. Their function is less of showing "advancement" but rather they act as a guide.

**SubstanceCraft Tab**

Has 3 subsections: Natural Resources, Workstations, and Agriculture.
The advance descriptions will show where to find/how to get the given item.

**Synthesis Tab**

Shows the recipe tree for certain syntheses.

*Since the vanilla advancement window is quite small, it is hard to see the large synthesis trees.
I would recommend installing [LargerAdvancementTab](https://github.com/ringlocker/LargerAdvancementTab/releases/tag/v0.1) (depends on modmenu, cloth-config)
